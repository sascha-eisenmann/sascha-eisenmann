An application to optimise the distribution of work packages across teams was developed. It enabled team leaders to distribute the work packages to their teams as easily as possible.

In addition a recommendation engine was developed that suggests an optimal distribution of work packages based on the given capacities, taking into account the possible profit and the workload for the employees.
