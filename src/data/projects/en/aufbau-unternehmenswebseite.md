The company's website was rebuilt. With the help of an external designer the required pages were created in Figma and approved with the customer.
Reusable components were then developed from these designs so that future pages could be quickly assembled from existing building blocks.
Netlify CMS was used to manage dynamic content such as blog posts, podcasts, and employee profiles. Deployment was done on the existing AWS infrastructure.
